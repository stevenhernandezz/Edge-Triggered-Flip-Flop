# Edge-Triggered-Flip-Flop
 This project includes an Edge Triggered Flip-Flop using hierarchical modeling approach.
 
## Description 
 This project includes an SR Latch circuit with delays. The SR Latch circuit contains 4 inputs s0, s1, r0, and r1. It also includes 2 NAND gates and 2 outputs Q, and Qnot. From this, I constructed a Positive Edge-Triggered D Flip-Flop. I calculated the longest path delay to be 31.4 ns which is 31.85 Mhz.
